        I’m a software developer currently shambling towards death in Berlin, Germany. I am
        creating my own set of aesthetically unified and ideosyncratic
        productivity tools, most notably [GEÞEODAN :: /hraew :: Hrǽw] and
        [GEÞEODAN :: /faereld :: Færeld]. I am also beginning to play around with
        hardware prototyping, as with my [GEÞEODAN :: /regn :: Regn] project.
        Outside of these projects, I am also a contributor to and maintainer of
        the [GEÞEODAN :: https://github.com/ambv/black :: Black] python formatter.

        Professionally, I am a developer and sysadmin at [GEÞEODAN :: https://crate.io/ :: Crate.io],
        a company building a horizontally scalable SQL database and a machine data
        platform. I spend most of my days creating things and building scalable
        infrastructures with Kubernetes, Docker and CrateDB. Alongside this, I
        also work a lot with release/distribution pipelines, tooling and drivers.

        Outside of software, I mostly read about technology, listen to ambient
        black metal and climb bouldering walls. I have not worn a colourful
        piece of clothing in my life.

# Project Leomu

tid:
  name: Tíd
  brief: Cooking Tool
  project: true
  status: 0.1.0
  bleoh: bearht
  head: Tíd is a timer and general purpose cooking tool.
  body: |
        This project is a successor to [GEÞEODAN :: /multitimer :: Multi/Timer],
        a cooking timer tool I made several years ago. The primary motivation
        behind this remake was to aesthetically unify it with my other projects,
        while at the same time removing superfluous features and strengthening
        those that remained.

        It is a tool that, primarily, allows you to time multiple cooking
        processes at once. This can be done with the UI, but a more expressive
        form of control has been implemented with a built in console.

        The console can be used to add, start, stop and delete specific timers,
        using commands such as:

        [GEWISSUNG]
        :add 00.30.00 Preferment
        Preferment [00.30.00] timer added

        :play 3
        Timer 3 deleted

        :delete all
        All timers deleted
        [GEWISSUNGENDE]

        The console also contains a basic ingredient amount conversion tool,
        which converts (mainly) between cups and metric units, though I will add
        more conversions to it as I encounter them in my cooking:

        [GEWISSUNG]
        :convert 3.5 cups flour to grams

        3.5 cups flour :: 437.50 grams
        [GEWISSUNGENDE]

        The conversion rules are modelled as an undirected and unweighted graph,
        so that I can then use the
        [GEÞEODAN :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm :: Floyd-Warshall algorithm]
        upon it order to find the shortest path between vertices. If I add a
        conversion rule for butter between grams and cups, and another between
        grams and sticks, the converter will automatically be able to convert
        between cups and sticks via the path cups ➡ grams ➡ sticks.

        The console also implements a help functionality, aiming to explain
        what each function does and how to perform them:

        [GEWISSUNG]
        :help

        Valid commands:
        help    :: Shows this help
        add     :: Add a new timer
        delete  :: Delete an existing timer
        play    :: Play an existing timer
        pause   :: Pause an existing timer
        convert :: Convert ingredient measures between units

        For help about a specific command, type :: help [command]

        :help add

        add :: Add a new timer

        SIGNATURES
        :add [TIME] [NAME] play
        :add [TIME] [NAME]
        :add [NAME]
        :add

        HELP
        Adding a timer can be done in several ways. The most basic is with [add], which
        will add a new paused timer with the default text of "New Timer" and a time of
        0.0.0.

        [add NAME] will add a paused timer with a time of 0.0.0, but with a defined name.
        e.g. :add My New Timer

        [add TIME NAME] will add a paused timer with a defined time and name. The time
        must be defined in the format [hours.minutes.seconds].
        e.g. :add 2.15.30 My New Timer

        [add TIME NAME play] will add a timer with a defined time and name, which will
        immediately start playing.
        e.g. :add 2.15.30 My New Timer play
        [GEWISSUNGENDE]

        This console based method of controlling the timers is more in line with
        my day-to-day workflow, and it's design is general enough that I may
        re-use it in other projects.

regn:

  brief: Weather Station
  project: true
  status: In Dev
  bleoh: bearht
  head: Regn is a WiFi enabled weather station and visualisation dashboard.
  body: |
        This project consists of 2 main components - a custom weather
        station and a data ingestion, API and dashboard server.

        The weather station is a WiFi enabled IoT device built with
        an [GEÞEODAN :: https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/adafruit-huzzah-esp8266-breakout.pdf :: Adafruit HUZZAH ESP8266],
        a [GEÞEODAN :: https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Temperature/DHT22.pdf :: DHT22 temperature + humidity sensor],
        a [GEÞEODAN :: https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/BST-BMP180-DS000-09.pdf :: BMP180 barometric pressure sensor]
        and a [GEÞEODAN :: https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/TSL2561.pdf :: TSL2561 luminosity/lux/light sensor]
        to read various environmental properties.

        Upon start-up, the weather station exposes a WiFi access point with the
        name [FRÆTWE :: REGOL :: Regn] and a predefined password. Connecting to
        this AP and navigating to [FRÆTWE :: REGOL :: 192.168.4.1] lets me
        set various internal settings, such as the MQTT endpoint and sensor read
        frequency, after which the station will reboot, connect to the defined
        WiFi point and begin to submit sensor data. It does this by connecting
        to an MQTT endpoint with it's Client ID being the station's name and
        publishing it's sensor values to a [FRÆTWE :: REGOL :: Regn] topic.

        [BILIÞ]
        [configuration_page.jpg :: Regn's first time boot configuration]

        As part of the hardware side of this project, I also used
        [GEÞEODAN :: https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview :: EAGLE]
        to design a PCB which was then fabricated by [GEÞEODAN :: https://oshpark.com/ :: OSH Park].
        At the moment it is only a basic PCB that links together the various
        prototype boards, but future versions will embed the sensors, voltage regulators,
        LEDs and other things directly.

        [BILIÞ]
        [pcb.jpg :: Version 0.1 PCB of Regn]

        The server side is relatively independent of the station. It serves a
        dashboard and an API for querying weather station data. It is a Flask
        service, and subscribes to the aforementioned [FRÆTWE :: REGOL :: Regn]
        MQTT topic and stores the sensor data in a database.

        The dashboard serves a real time graph of temperature, humidity, pressure
        and luminosity values over a chosen timespan of day, week, month or year.

  project: true
  status: 1.1.0

  head: Ametan is an Android app for scrum estimation planning poker.
  body: |
        Planning poker is an exercise I regularly take part in with my
        colleagues in order to determine the complexity of stories that we will
        undertake during a sprint. The procedure is to estimate the complexity
        of a story from a set of 0, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100, ∞ and ?.
        Each team member's estimation is then revealed at the same time, in order
        to minimise influence from other members. The highest and the lowest
        estimations are then discussed, and a consensus is reached over several
        estimation rounds.

        There are many Android apps that facilitate this, but none that I had
        encountered quite suited my aesthetic tastes, so I decided to build one
        for myself.

        This was also an exercise in Android development, Kotlin and learning
        the names for numbers in Old English.

        The service is built with Flask and runs as a Docker container, allowing
        for easy scaling with demand, since the service itself is stateless and
        gets its information via the public APIs of the relevant services.

        Scieldas currently supports Travis CI, ReadTheDocs, the Python Package
        Index (both the current latest package version and the supported Python
        versions) and Docker Hub. It also exposes an endpoint to create licence

        [GEÞEODAN :: https://joshavanier.github.io/wiki/ :: Josh Avanier's Memex],
        Hrǽw is a project information engine built with Flask to facilitate
        cataloguing of my projects. It uses a custom parsing engine to translate
        simple texts with tags into HTML. It is also designed to incorporate
        data produced by [GEÞEODAN :: /faereld :: Færeld] so that summaries of
        project activity can be built and visualised.

        Although intended to be served as a Flask instance (currently on Heroku),
        Hrǽw also has the ability to be "frozen" into a static site. This allows
        me to also have a static version of Hrǽw in
        [GEÞEODAN :: dat://hraew.autophagy.io :: the P2P web] via the
        [GEÞEODAN :: https://datproject.org/ :: Dat Protocol].

        Hrǽw is intended to fulfil several functions. The first is to act as a
        portfolio of sorts - a consistent catalogue of my personal projects.
        Secondly, it is intended as a way of generating Færeld visualisations in
        a way that would be impractical with its CLI. Lastly, it is intended to
        function as a self-esteem booster, an indicator that I am spending my time
        on useful and interesting stuff.

        In the future, Hrǽw may expand to contain not only information about my
        personal projects, but perhaps more information about me generally.

        Hwǽte was a blog started in Snáw 225 to document my bread baking. Since
        then, it has expanded to encompass anything involving dough, wheat or
        baking generally. Most of the recipes or inspiration come from Rose Levy
        Beranbaum's The Bread Bible and Ken Forkish's Flour Water Salt Yeast.

        It is created using the [GEÞEODAN :: https://jekyllrb.com/ :: Jekyll]
        static site generation framework.

mainframe:
  name: MAINFRAME
  brief: Cyberpunk Game
  project: true
  status: 1.0
  bleoh: bearht
  head: MAINFRAME is a web game, inspired by Warioware and bad 90s movies about hacking.
  body: |
        MAINFRAME is a tongue-in-cheek cyberpunk game about cracking the
        mainframes of various Corps through a series of quick minigames loosely
        based on hacking techniques. Make 3 mistakes, and you burn through
        all your proxies and come face to face with every hacker's nightmare:
        black ICE.

        The game was made over several months with the
        [GEÞEODAN :: https://phaser.io/ :: Phaser] HTML5 game framework. It was
        featured in Rock, Paper, Shotgun's
        [GEÞEODAN :: https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/02/27/best-free-games-of-the-week-13/ :: best free games of the week].

multitimer:

  head: Multi/Timer is a tool for timing multiple cooking processes simultaneously.
  body: |
        Multi/Timer is a tool I built while at Chaos Communication Camp 2015,
        born out of frustration with the age and jankyness of a lot of the
        timing applications I used while cooking, and has become a tool that I
        use nearly every day.

        It was created in order to enable me to time multiple cooking processes
        at once, while being able to view their progress as one whole. It has
        gone under a few redesigns, and has been a useful exercise in UI design.

twitter-bg-restorer:

  brief: Chrome Extension
  project: true
  status: 2.0.3
  bleoh: deorc
  head: Twitter Bg Restorer is a chrome extension to restore Twitter's background.
  body: |
        The extension was created when Twitter removed the ability to set the
        background image/colour of the homepage in 2015, instead giving everyone
        a boring, eye-searing white background. Given Twitter's monumental
        whitespace, this made looking at the timeline difficult.

        There also exists a version for Mozilla Firefox.

        It has been featured in
